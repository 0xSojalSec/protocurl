# Tests

The tests are run automatically via GitHub Actions [here](.github/workflows/test.yml).

To run the tests locally:

1. Install `https://stedolan.github.io/jq/` into `test/suite/jq` (executable)
2. Run tests via `./test/suite/test.sh "$PWD"` (bash) from the repository root directory.
   * It needs the full path to the current working directory, as otherwise the docker volume mount fails in WSL on
     Windows. Concretely, on WSL Windows, we need to use `./test/suite/test.sh "c:/path/to/protocurl/repository"`

### How the tests work

The tests start the local NodeJS based server from `test/servers/server.ts` inside a docker container and send requests
from `test/suite/testcases.json` against the testserver. Each testcase is of the form

```
{
  "filename": "<a filename without spaces and without extension>",
  "args": [
    "<arguments for protocurl>",
    "<These are split into an array to make it easier to write them in the JSON file.>",
    "<All of these array elements will be concatenated with spaces.>"
  ]
}
```

For each testcase, the `args` array will be concatenated and the concatenated string will be given to `protocurl` (via
docker run) as arguments. This happens via `test/suite/run-testcases.sh` - which is dynamically created from the JSON.
This script contains lines of the form

```
testSingleRequest '<filename>' '<args concatenated with spaces>'
```

During the execution of each line in this script, the output will be written into `test/results/$FILENAME-out.txt` -
which will be compared via `diff` to `test/results/$FILENAME-expected.txt`. If both match, then the result is accepted.

Lines containing `Date: ` and will be ignored during the diffing, as they are runtime dependent and their difference is
not relevant to the correctness of the code. Additionally, parts of the Go trace on crashes is also ignored, since the
memory addresses in them are unstable.

**Examples for the inputs, outputs and arguments can hence be found in the test/results directory as well as
test/suite/testcases.json.**

### Adding new tests

To add a test, simply add a new entry into `test/suite/testcases.json` and run the tests. The tests will generate an
empty expected output file and copy the actual output side by side. You can inspect the actual output and copy it into
the expected-output file when you are happy.

### Example tests run

Running the tests might look like this:
